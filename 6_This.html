		//=========================================This & Bind:
		
		/*
		In most cases 'this' is determined by how a function is called. 
		It cant be set by assignment during execution, and may be different each time the function is called
		ES5 introduced the bind method to set the value of a function's "this" regardless of how it's called. 
		Bind creates a new function that will have "this set to the first parameter passed to bind().
		*/
		
		
		//In objects, 'this' is set to the object the method is called on.
		
		
		let cat = {};
		
		cat = {
			sound: "meow",
			speak: function(){
					console.log(this.sound); //'this' here refers to the obj (same as saying 'cat.sound')
				}
		};
		
		cat.speak();
		
		//here a FUNCTION is being assigned. Not a METHOD being called, so 'this' has lost it's context: 
		let speakFunction = cat.speak;
		
		speakFunction(); //contextless, so undefined
		
		//Binding 'this' to the object. 
		//'this' in the speak function when called will now look to the cat object for context. 
		let speakFunctionBind = speakFunction.bind(cat); 
		
		speakFunctionBind();
		
		//+++++++++Another example:+++++++++
		
		//two person objects:
		let person1 = {
			name: "Alex"
		};
		
		let person2 = {
			name: "Alexis"
		};
		
		//function for returning name:
		function namer(){
			return this.name; //no context provided for 'this'. (it isn't naming person1 or person2)
		}
		
		
		//Binding 'this' in namer function to person1, THEN invoking the namer function.
		let bindExample1 = namer.bind(person1)(); //DONT FORGET THE INVOCATION!!
		console.log(bindExample1);
		
		
		//+++++++++Another example:+++++++++
		
		let number = {
			x: 24,
			y: 22
		};
		
		let count = function(){
			console.log(this.x + this.y);
		}
		
		//binding 'this' in count function to number, THEN invoking the count function.
		count.bind(number)();
		//OR:
		newFunc = count.bind(number);
		newFunc();
		
		
		//=========================================This & Call:
		
		/*
		The call() method calls a function with a given 'this' value and arguments provided individually: 
		
		func.call(object, arg1, arg2..)
		
		A FUNCTION is different from a METHOD, in that a method is a function ATTACHED to an object.
		Which would then give the 'this' keyword context. 

		Because call() is on a function the 'this' keyword doesn't have context.
