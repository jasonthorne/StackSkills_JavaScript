		//==============================This & Bind:
		
		/*
		In most cases 'this' is determined by how a function is called. 
		It cant be set by assignment during execution, and may be different each time the function is called
		ES5 introduced the bind method to set the value of a function's "this" regardless of how it's called. 
		Bind creates a new function that will have "this set to the first parameter passed to bind().
