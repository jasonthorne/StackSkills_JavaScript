		//==============================Let Statements==============================
		
		/*
		Let Statement:
		Allows for BLOCK SCOPE to declare a local variable. 
		This differs from the VAR keyword, which declares a variable
		globally or locally (to the scope of a function).
		*/
		
		//VAR & LET:
	
		//Both can be assigned & reassigned:
		var greeting = "yo";
		greeting = "sup";
		let name = "Biggles";
		name = "Archibald the 3rd";
		
		//VAR keyword can be used again on an already declared variable:
		var greeting = "howdy"; //no error
		
		//Let however, causes a syntax error known as a "Temporal Dead Zone"
		//let name = "Cuthbert"; 
		
		
		//-----------------
		//Function Scope (using vars):
		
		var count1 = 4; //global scope
		
		if (true){
			var more1 = 1; //also global scope (as not in a function)
		}
		
		console.log(count1 + more1); //both vars are visible
		
		//-----------------
		//Block Scope (using let):
		
		let count2 = 6; 
		
		if (true){
			let more2 = 2; //variable is scoped ONLY to this block
		}
		
		//console.log(count2 + more2); //gives error that 'more2' is not defined globally
		
		//==============================Const Statement:==============================
		
		/*
		Const:
		Creates a value that is a READ-ONLY reference. It can be either global of local
		to the function or block in which it's declared, as you cant change the reference
		or literal that is assigned to it.
		
		
				CONST 	   | 		LET			| 		 VAR
		------------------------------------------------------------
			block scoped   | 	block scoped 	| 	function scoped
						   |					|
		temporal dead zone | temporal dead zone | 
						   |					|
			read only	   |	reassign value	| 	reassign value
		
		*/
		
		const API_KEY = "can't change me, sucka!";
		//API_KEY = "No dice!";
		
		
		//==============================Template Literals==============================
		/*
		Template Literal:
		+ Template literals are enclosed by the BACK TICK.
		+ They replace the string or double quotes used in strings.
		+ They may contain placeholders: 
			- Indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces.
			- The expressions in the placeholders (including text contained between them) are passed to a function.
			- The parts are concatenated by the default function into a single string.
		*/
		
		//New lines: 
		var sentence = `back ticks instead of quotes 
		also allow for carriage return.`;
		console.log(sentence);
		
		//-----------
		//Template Literal example:
		var topping1 = "pepperoni";
		var topping2 = "anchovies";
		
		//no need for concatenating strings and adding necessary spaces! 
		var pizzaToppings = `My favourite pizza has ${topping1} and ${topping2}!`; 
		console.log(pizzaToppings);
		
		//-----------
		//Another example:
		
		var pizza = {
			topping1:"pepperoni",
			topping2: "anchovies",
			favouritePizza: function(){
				return `My favourite pizza has ${topping1} and ${topping2}!`;
			}
		}
		
		console.log(pizza.favouritePizza());
		
		//==============================Arrow Functions:==============================
		/*
		Arrow Functions (=>):
		A more concise syntax for writing function expressions.
		They are anonymous and change the way "this" binds in functions.
		*/
		
		//traditional function:
		var myFunc1 = function(){ //assigning a variable the value of an anonymous function (with no params)
			return 2;
		}
		
		//Arrow function:
		var myFunc2 = () => 2;
		
		/*
		+ NO 'function' keyword.
		+ The parentheses are sometimes optional. (NEEDED HERE as there are no input params).  
		+ Implicit return, without needing curly braces.
		*/
		
		
		//-----------
		//Arrow function with one parameter: (parentheses optional)
		
		var cubed;
		//example1:
		cubed = x => x*x*x; //x is input param. x*x*x is implicit return.
		//example2:
		cubed = x => {return x*x*x}; //adding a block body requires an explicit return statement.
		//example3:
		cubed = (x) => x*x*x; //parentheses around input param. Implicit return.
		//example4:
		cubed = (x) => {return x*x*x}; //parentheses around input param. Block body requiring an explicit return
		
		
		//-----------
		//Arrow function with twp parameters: (parentheses NEEDED!)
		
		var add;
		//example1:
		add = (x,y) => x+y; //x and y are input params. x+y is implicit return.
		//example2:
		add = (x,y) => {return x+y}; //adding a block body requires an explicit return statement.
		//example3:
		add = (x,y,z) => x+y+z; //3 input params.
